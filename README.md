This is my I3 log page system.

It's my attempt to preserve the InterMUD chat logs and provide
a fun and clean way to view them, and flip around through their
history.

I used to have these as part of WileyMUD's home directory, but
when I abandoned Apache in favor of Nginx, I decided it would
be cleaner to just move all this into a new directory structure
that can easily be installed anywhere else.

This is the starting point from that move.  I don't know of
a nice way to extract the git history from the old subset of
the repository and graft it onto this one, so if you want
to see the evolution, go look at my WileyMUD github archive
and paw through the public_html/log area.
